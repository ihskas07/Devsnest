<p> Dear Sir/Madam, <br><br>
    I am writing to request permission for organizing a mentorship program in our college. It will be conducted by Devsnest.<br>
	It is a mentorship program designed to help one get their dream job. It evolves as per ones needs to mould them into a good<br>
	developer. It is a 6 months training program where students will be guided to become a profficient develeper from scratch.<br>
	Prerequisities for the program will be<br>
<ul>
  <li>Basic Understanding of English and Maths</li>
  <li>Basic Understanding of Python Language</li>
  <li>Be a part of community, be ready to spend 2-3 hours a week with your peers, learning together</li>
  <li>Motivation to learn</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>The course curriculum will be as follows<br></p>

<head>
<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
th, td {
  padding: 5px;
}
th {
  text-align: left;
}
</style>
</head>
<table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <td>Week 1-10</td>
    <td>Basic Programming and DSA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 11-17</td>
    <td>WebDev - Frontend</td>  
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 18-24</td>
    <td>WebDev - Backend</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 25-32</td>
    <td>Interview Prep</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> It is a free of cost learning platfrom which makes education financially independent. Regular live interactive classes<br>
    brings a fun class-like atmosphere virtually. This program encourages group collaboration and pair programming and <br>
	enables peer learning. Tech Talks by industry experts on trending technologies keep students upgraded to the latest version.
</p>
<p>Therefore, I will be highly obeliged if you allow us to organize this training program in our college. Thanking you in<br>
   anticipation.<br><br>
Yours obediently,<br>
Sakshi Singh.<br>
