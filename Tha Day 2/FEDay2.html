</p>
<p> Dear Sir/Madam, <br><br>
    I am writing to request permission for organizing a mentorship program in our college. It will be conducted by Devsnest.<br>
	It is a mentorship program designed to help one get their dream job. It evolves as per ones needs to mould them into a good<br>
	developer. It is a 6 months training program where students will be guided to become a profficient develeper from scratch.<br>
</p>
<p3>Prerequisities for the program will be</p3><br>
<ul>
<i>  <li>Basic Understanding of English and Maths</li>
  <li>Basic Understanding of Python Language</li>
  <li>Be a part of community, be ready to spend 2-3 hours a week with your peers, learning together</li>
  <li>Motivation to learn</li> </i>
</ul> 
</p>
<p1>The course curriculum will be as follows<br></p1>

<table style="width:50%">
 <tr>
    <td>Week 1-10</td>
    <td>Basic Programming and DSA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 11-17</td>
    <td>WebDev - Frontend</td>  
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 18-24</td>
    <td>WebDev - Backend</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Week 25-32</td>

  </tr>
</table>
<p> It is a free of cost learning platfrom which makes education financially independent. Regular live interactive classes<br>
    brings a fun class-like atmosphere virtually. This program encourages group collaboration and pair programming and <br>
	enables peer learning. Tech Talks by industry experts on trending technologies keep students upgraded to the latest version.<br>
